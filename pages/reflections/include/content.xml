            This piece of work is an example banknote of a fictitious currency. The background depicts a circuit board-like design along with the silhouette of a city or the solar system. A picture of the sun as well as the globe and an atom are included on the
            bill as watermarks. The foreground picture on front and back of the bill is Bill Nye the Science Guy and a chimpanzee, respectively. All of these images are related to the overall science theme of this bill. Three skills I gained while completing
            this project were cropping irregularly shaped images, changing the opacity of images, and manipulating the colour tone of images. Two skills I would like to strengthen are the ability of incorporate a cohesive colour scheme as well as intricate
            background designs.
