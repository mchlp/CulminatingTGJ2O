            This portfolio was created hayk, an self-taught designer and coder. Something I like about this portfolio is its simplistic design and cohesive colour scheme. The web page is designed with short lines of text as well as simple graphics, which are
            very effective in conveying his ideas. The overall grey colour scheme with a tint of teal is quite visually appealing. I conprotated these into my portfolio by including as little text as necessary, and where long chunks of text are needed, the text
            is arranged into a visually appealing manner. My webpage features a dark grey and white colour scheme with a bit of green in an attempt to match the simple colour scheme in this portfolio.
